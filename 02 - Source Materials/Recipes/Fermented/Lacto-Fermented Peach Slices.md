## Description
A simple and refreshing way to ferment peach slices.

## Ingredients
- - 4-5 peaches, sliced
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 1-2 tablespoons honey (optional)
- Filtered water

## Instructions

2. Dissolve sea salt in a little warm water, then mix with filtered water and honey (if using) to make a brine solution. The total amount of water needed will depend on the size of your jar.
3. Pour the brine over the peach slices, ensuring they are fully submerged. Leave about 1 inch of headspace.
4. Cover the jar with a fermentation lid or a cloth secured with a rubber band.
5. Let ferment at room temperature for 3-7 days, checking daily and pressing the fruit down if it rises above the brine.
6. Once fermented to your liking, store in the refrigerator.

## Notes
These make a great snack or salad topping.
