## Description
These Almond Joy–Inspired Energy Balls feature the distinctive nuttiness of coconut plus dark chocolate and a creamy almond butter center to deliver all the classic flavors of the popular candy bar. Make these energy balls ahead of time for a grab-and-go breakfast or morning snack.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup pitted dates (about 5 ounces)
- 1/3 cup unsalted dry-roasted almonds
- 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1/4 cup unsalted, unsweetened thick almond butter plus 2 tablespoons, divided
- 2 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil
- 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon coconut extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 ounce dark chocolate (70% cacao), broken into pieces

## Instructions
1. Place dates in a small heatproof bowl; cover with boiling water. Let stand until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
2. Meanwhile, pulse almonds in a food processor until coarsely chopped, about 8 pulses. Add the drained dates, coconut, 1/4 cup almond butter, coconut oil, cocoa, coconut extract, and salt; process until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl; cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
3. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon 1 tablespoon date mixture onto a clean work surface; gently press into a 2-inch round (about 1/8-inch thick). Spoon about 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining almond butter in the center of the round. Carefully pinch the date mixture around the almond butter to seal; roll between your palms to form a smooth ball. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining date mixture and almond butter.
4. Microwave chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl on High until melted, about 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds.
5. Drizzle the balls evenly with the melted chocolate. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
