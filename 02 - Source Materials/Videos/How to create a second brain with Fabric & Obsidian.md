#### Notes
In this video the goal is combining the two  tools, Obsidian with a Zattelkaten setup, combined with the automated set of tools called Fabric, which uses AI and meridian to create knowledge bases quickly and can be enhanced with open patterns with are essential shared prompts that are structured, open, and shared. 
The example and setup are simple but one can easily see the power of the two systems in concert. The beauty and power in using Fabric is that the patterns are a powerful way to craft specific prompts with the added benefit of the output being native markdown with pairs perfectly with Obsidian.
