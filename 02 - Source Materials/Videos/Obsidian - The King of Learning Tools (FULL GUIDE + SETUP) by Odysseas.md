### Notes
Ultimate Setup for Obsidian for writing and organizing source material, like videos, books, articles, etc., and then referencing them in notes. These source material notes then get status & tags attached, the reference to the source material, then notes. These notes are in-depth analysis's of the source and have quotes, ideas, and thoughts on the material. The next step to create a full note from one of the small note ideas that came from the source material notes.
